Did not finish Bonus or Bonus Statistical Analysis.
I redid my original formulas because I initially used Named Ranges and mistakenly just used the entire column.  I found I could like the ranges from 2 to 1001.
I would like to work on the Bonus sheets some more and submit those later, if I can.

I completely redid the homework using a new download of the CrowdfundingBook from GitLab.  No SPILL errors this time and a greatly reduced file size.
